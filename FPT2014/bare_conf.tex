% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures.


%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}

\section{Introduction}

%\subsection{FPGA Architecture}


\section{Digit-parallel Online Adder on FPGAs}
\subsection{Related Works}
There has been previous works focusing on efficient FPGA implementation of the digit-parallel online adder. Generally the existing approaches can be classified into three types:%, as discussed below. A more detailed review of current works can be found in xxx.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item efficient mapping of the digit-parallel online adder onto sophisticated FPGAs resources [xxx];
	\item multiple operands addition by designing compressor trees based on bit counters [xxx];
	\item modifying existing FPGA architecture for more efficient online addition [xxx] and for specific applications [xxx].
\end{enumerate}

Type 2 and type 3 are beyond the scope of this paper, as we focus on the general purpose online adder that takes 2 inputs and generate 1 outputs, as shown in Figure xxx. Specifically in type 1, both works took advantage of the built-in carry resources in FPGAs. Conventionally the ASIC implementation of online adders is based on the 4:2 compressors, as shown within the gray background in Figure xxx. However, directly applying this approach in the FPGAs could be less efficient. This is because there is no carry propagation between the 2 full adders within a 4:2 compressor, and the net delay between them can be large. Instead, Kamp et al and Ortiz et al described very similar mapping techniques for online adders with 2 different data representations, respectively. The main idea is to map the logic block within the dotted circle in Figure xxx. In this case, the fast-carry logic in the FPGA can be employed, and the delay between the 2 FAs is largely reduced. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{./Figures/SDAdder_42comp_Spartan.pdf}
	\caption{Map the online adder onto Spartan FPGAs using the fast-carry resources. The grey background highlights the 4:2 compressor. Dotted circle indicates the logic block (LB) which can be mapped to the FPGA carry resources.}
\end{figure}

However, we notice the major limitations of both approaches that they only target on FPGAs with 4-input LUTs and 2 LUTs within a logic slice, such as the Xilinx Spartan series and the Altera Cyclone series. This is naturally reasonable because one LB can be mapped to a single slice. Nevertheless, for FPGAs with 6-input LUTs and 4 LUTs in a slice, such as the Xilinx Virtex series and all Xilinx 7 series FPGAs, directly applying the approaches in [xxx] will result in either resource waste or logic fault. For instance, if 2 LBs are mapped to a slice with 4 LUTs as seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:PreviousWork}, the outputs of the second LB will be faulty because the its carry input cannot be initialized.

\section{Results}



% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
