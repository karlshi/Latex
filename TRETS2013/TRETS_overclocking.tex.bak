\begin{abstract}
As process scaling introduces significant performance variations, much more conservative timing margins will have to be applied to avoid timing violations. Potentially, releasing the tight accuracy requirement would offer greater freedom to create a design with better performance or energy efficiency. In this paper, we compare two different approaches that could trade accuracy for performance. One is the traditional approach where the precision used in the datapath is limited to meet a target latency. The other is a proposed new approach which simply allows the datapath to operate without timing closure. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that on average our approach obtains either smaller errors or faster operating frequencies in comparison to the traditional approach. This is because the worst case caused by timing violations only happens rarely, while the precision loss results in errors to most data. We also show that for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, applying our approach to simple operators (i.e. ripple carry adders) can achieve better accuracy or performance than using the traditional method to both original operators and intrinsically faster operators (i.e. carry select adders) which consumes the same silicon area.

\subsection{Frequency Assignment}


% Numbered Equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:01}
P(t)=\frac{b^{\frac{t+1}{T+1}}-b^{\frac{t}{T+1}}}{b-1},
\end{equation}
where $t=0,{\ldots}\,,T$, and $b$ is a number greater than $1$.


% Unnumbered Equation
\[
i=\lfloor(T+1)\log_b[\alpha(b-1)+1]\rfloor.
\]
It can be easily proven that the distribution of $i$ conforms to Equation
(\ref{eqn:01}).

\subsubsection{Exclusive Frequency Assignment}

In exclusive frequency assignment, nodes first exchange their IDs
among two communication hops so that each node knows its two-hop
neighbors' IDs. In the second broadcast, each node beacons all
neighbors' IDs it has collected during the first broadcast period.

\section{Typical references in new ACM Reference Format}
A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated
journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue \cite{JCohen96},
a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation \cite{Editor00}
followed by the same example, however we only output the series if the volume number is given
\cite{Editor00a} (so Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book
in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97},
an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example)

with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07},
an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85},
